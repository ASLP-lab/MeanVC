# MeanVC: Lightweight and Streaming Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Mean Flows

📑 [Paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08392) |  🌐[Demo](https://aslp-lab.github.io/MeanVC/)

MeanVC is a lightweight and streaming zero-shot voice conversion system that enables real-time timbre transfer from any source speaker to any target speaker while preserving linguistic content. The system introduces a diffusion transformer with chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy and mean flows for efficient single-step inference.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 Streaming Inference**: Real-time voice conversion with chunk-wise processing
- **⚡ Single-Step Generation**: Direct mapping from start to endpoint via mean flows
- **🎯 Zero-Shot Capability**: Convert to any unseen target speaker without training
- **💾 Lightweight**: Significantly fewer parameters than existing methods
- **🔊 High Fidelity**: Superior speech quality and speaker similarity


## 📋 TODO

- [x] 🌐 **Demo website**
- [x] 📝 **Paper release**
- [ ] 🤗 **HuggingFace model release**
- [ ] 🔓 **Release inference code**
- [ ] 🔓 **Release training code**
